Hi everyone! We are very pleased to publicly announce **NearForm** as one of our **Platinum Plus** sponsors.

We are very happy to have NearForm as one of our sponsors.  NearForm was one of the first companies to adopt Node.js in the enterprise, they organize the Node.js European Conference, and it is probably the company that has contributed the most to the growth of the JavaScript community in Ireland.

Below you will find some imformation about the relationship between NearForm and the JavaScript community in Ireland.

## What is NearForm and what do you do?

We are headquartered in Tramore in Waterford and design, build and deliver customised enterprise-grade cloud native solutions. We’ve grown from a small Irish software start-up, founded in 2012, to a highly-regarded global partner of some of the world’s most recognised brands. We are known for accelerating innovation strategies, improving delivery models and building in-house capabilities for repeatable success.  Our distributed workforce of designers, developers and devops specialists and our established remote-first model means we readily service clients across the globe using best of breed design, technology and modern practices for software development.  We now have people in over 27 countries!  

## How is NearForm connected to the JS community in Ireland?

Javascript and open source are part of our DNA.  We engage in ongoing research and contribution to the javascript open source frameworks, libraries and tools to ensure we always deliver the best for our clients and to allow us, as developers, to continually expand our skills and knowledge base. We contribute to many major open source projects such as HTTP, Fastify, Hapi, Pino, npm, Clinic.js, GraphQL and React and are currently the largest contributor to Node.js (you might be interested in listening to John Papa’s recent podcast with NearForm’s Matteo Collina [here](https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm/56c29daf)).  This is not possible without a strong ecosystem for collaboration!  

Community is very much at the heart of what we do and with NearForm being an Irish company, the JS Community in Ireland has always been key to us.  We love to find ways to share ideas.  We run a monthly Dublin node.js meet-up and an annual nodejs European conference in Kilkenny - both are in their 8th year and growing in size!  

Of course, we have a vested interest in nurturing the skills pool in Ireland too.  We’re delighted to be able to offer some great opportunities at NearForm for Javascript developers to advance their careers - taking on exciting projects and pushing the boundaries. All NearFormers are encouraged and supported to explore and utilise emerging technologies - all the while in a remote-first environment.  We are almost always on the lookout for new talent!

## Why is NearForm excited for JSDayIE?

We are so excited to be part of the first Javascript conference in Ireland.  Congratulations to all involved!  We look forward to meeting with like-minded people to share, learn, exchange ideas and of course hear from some of the best JavaScript professionals and organisations around.

David Gonzalez, our DevOps Consultant, will be giving a talk about building DevOps friendly applications, making them easier to operate and maintain using 12 Factor Javascript Applications on Kubernetes.  He is going to walk through the process of building a DevOps friendly Javascript app following best practices.  We are looking forward to hearing the questions afterwards - it’s always the best part as you get to see what it means to others across the community and how they see the technology being applied!
