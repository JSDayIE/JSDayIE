# JSDayIE 2019 CFP now open!

The JSDayIE 2019 CFP is now open! We’re excited to welcome the JavaScript community to submit talks for JSDayIE 2019 that will take place on September 20th 2019. The Call for Proposals closes on April 15th, 2019.

We are looking for a multitude of topics and perspectives but most of all we value:

- **Original topics**, presented for the first time

- **Practical ideas** that attendees can apply at work the next day

- **Trends and hot topics** which are relevant in 2019 and beyond

- **Fresh perspectives** on the JS ecosystem

We don't have a specific theme for JSDayIE. Instead, we’re aiming to select talks that are interesting for as many JavaScript developers as possible. Our audience skill level is intermediate to advanced.

All talks should be in English and 25 minutes long. We will be on a tight schedule and will enforce the time limits rigorously. We suggest that you time your presentation accordingly in advance.

## We can help

Not everyone is a natural-born talent on stage. Not everyone can produce kick-ass slide decks. Not everyone is a live-demo master. Not everyone knows they have something great to talk about.

There are about a million reasons why you may not consider yourself a speaker. We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to help you develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.

We are committed to fulfilling our mission as a community event. We are all community people and we want to be as close to you as possible. We will try to be supportive and helpful and we will do our best to get back to you with valuable feedback from the CFP process. In case you wish to talk with someone from the team, do not hesitate to write an email at [info@jsday.ie](mailto:info@jsday.ie) (just please don’t use this email to submit a proposal). Good luck!

Good luck!
