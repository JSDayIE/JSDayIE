# JSDayIE 2023 tickets are now available!

We are proud to announce that the JSDayIE 2023 tickets are now on sale!

We are working very hard to beat the quality that we managed to put together in 2019. This year we are offering the exact tickets in 2019 plus new Remote access.

To integrate the in-person and remote experiences, we have decided to collaborate with Vi.to. Vi.to is an online tool that allows conferences like JSDayIE to create an online community for our 2023 event. You will be able to use our Vi.to Hub to stream the talks and interact with all attedees (in-person and remote), sponsors and speakers. You can think about it as a private version of Youtube + Twitter.

- **Remote** This is the right ticket for those who would like to interact and the JavaScript community in Ireland and enjoy our amazing talks from the comfort of their homes or offices. If your organization doesn't have enough travel budget or you are not fast enough to secure one of the in-person tickets. This ticket provides you with access to our Vi.to Hub. The Remote Ticket is only 15 EUR and is unlimited, and it gives you access to our Vi.to Hub.

- **Founder** This ticket is our way to thank all the members willing to support this event from a very early stage.
