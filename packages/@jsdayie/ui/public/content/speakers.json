One way of solving these problems is with a monorepo - but that brings problems in itself around scalability and maintainability... enter Nx! In this talk we'll discuss how Nx can help you to manage a monorepo, and why we chose to use it at ClearScore. We will dive into how it can help you to generate new projects, its smart ability to know what's changed and only rebuild what it absolutely needs to, and how its distributed nature can reduce the time you spend waiting for CICD pipelines to run.</p>"

ReactJS is a javascript library that was introduced to make building javascript applications faster and easier. When React was introduced to the frontend ecosystem, it heavily promoted Webpack as a build tool for React. The React team included Webpack in the official React boilerplate code generator(create-react-app). All was well until developers started noticing how slow and difficult setting up Webpack from scratch can be if they decided not to use CRA. This frustration led to the birth of several other build tools meant to solve WebPack issues and make building React Apps faster and easier to set up. In this talk, I'll be exploring the following React build tools (Webpack and Babel, Parcel, Vite, Rollup, Turbopack), their benefits, their drawbacks, their speed, etc.</p>"
