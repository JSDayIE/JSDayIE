      "abstract": "The ability to capture and share data and learn from it has changed what we are able to do with technology drastically. Although our lives are changed with the new wealth of data, the way we interact with data has changed very little. Just like people a century ago, we are trying to make sense of everything through their 2D abstractions, whether it is writing, illustrations or excel sheets. Today we have the technology to interact with any data in the right context and right space. We can make sense of really complex problems by modeling them in 3d. Our way of consuming information is changing to fit the information itself and becoming more intuitive and actionable. Join us to get a glimpse into the future of user interaction."

      "abstract": "As technology advances and the applications we build become more complex, the tools that we use to secure the data shared within these products need to follow suit. We need to ensure that we deliver a high standard of protection to users, allowing them them to seamlessly use the product without thinking about security or any potential threat. Even just a thought of any risk could lose us our customersâ€™ trust and therefore millions in investment and in turn threaten our entire business as a whole (including our jobs). A security breach is a very real problem, both personally as an individual and professionally in a business sense. But we as developers can help fix this problem. In very recent years there has been a number of incidents involving npm dependencies pushing vulnerabilities to consumers or exposing data. This led to the npm team purchasing a security tool to prevent future incidents. These incidents can easily be stopped and further prevented from happening again.  NPM is the first main carrier of personal information and it therefore should be where we start to repair these issues. In this talk we will look back on the previous incidents and do a postmortem investigation on what happened, and how it could have been prevented. We will then take a further look into tools and products that can help protect our applications going forward and some basic best security practices that we all should follow, no matter our application."

So, let's start with a projet that need a huge computing time. We will develop the core code in Rust, compile it to WASM using LLVM, and we will display the results in a front view powered via JavaScript. No need to know how does it work, we will see it together.

In the second half, the talk segues into a reflection on the struggles of learning new technologies and the anxiety and fears of becoming irrelevant in the future job market. Is the constant need to up-skill and re-invent ourselves the price we pay for the premium salaries we get? And is our quest to add more acronyms to our CVs make us lose sight the bigger picture?"
