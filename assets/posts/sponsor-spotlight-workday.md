Workday has helped us not only financially but by encouraging its employees to participate in the CFP process. We would like to sincerely thank Workday for becoming one of our Platinum sponsors because, without their support, this event would not be possible. As a sponsor of JSDayIE and one of the best employers in Ireland, Workday is contributing to the healthy growth of the JS community in Ireland.

Below you will find some imformation about the relationship between Workday and the JavaScript community in Ireland.

## What is Workday and what do you do?

Workday is a leading provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources. Founded in 2005, Workday delivers financial management, human capital management, planning, and analytics applications designed for the worldâ€™s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Organizations ranging from medium-sized businesses to Fortune 50 enterprises have selected Workday. 

## How is Workday connected to the JS community in Ireland?

All in all, at Workday Dublin, we just love coding and innovating. We are extremely fortunate that our location and space allows us to regularly host meetups and hackathons inviting some of the most talented engineers in the Irish market to share, learn and code with us. These are organised and hosted by our own people and we hope that by enabling these events we are somewhat helping the engineering community in Dublin to continue growing and connecting. 

## Why is Workday excited for JSDayIE?

At Workday Dublin we have over 1000 people onsite with 85% of these working in tech roles. We're not just doing bits of code that are off to the side, we are working on core development that is central to our product as a whole. We're techies, so what is not to get excited about with JS day. We cannot wait to have the opportunity to further connect with the JavaScript community and have our engineers learn and hopefully share their knowledge. 

We are looking forward to seeing you there and make sure to come see us at our stand or talk to some of our engineers on the floor!
