# What does “pronoun” mean when I buy a ticket?

Instead of only printing your name and optionally your company name on your badge, this year we will be printing your pronouns on it as well. Pronouns are the words people use to refer to you in place of your name, such as “he”, “she” or “they” (yes, a singular they). In the past years, we’ve given out pronoun pins that you could wear, but we’ve decided to make it an option for everybody this year. If you have further questions, please email contact@jsconf.eu!

What is a support person?
In case you are invited to CSSconf and/or JSDayIE in any role (speaker, scholarship holder, MC, artist), you are asked, if you need a support person to attend the event either for support during travel and/or during the whole event. If needed and you can’t afford to cover the extra costs for a support person, we are happy to cover the costs for you and help with travel, accommodation and a ticket to the conference(s).

A support person is necessary to protect the health and safety of the person with impairments/disabilities during the travel and/or events.

The role of a support person is for example:

Sign Language interpretation
Prompting or giving advice, including requesting a break if needed
Providing physical support during travel and/or the event
Providing emotional support and reassurance during travel and/or the event
How can I get an invitation letter for my visa?
In order to obtain a visa invitation letter from us, please fill out this form. This might take some time, so if your country has specific time restrictions on visas, please let us know beforehand.

Do you recommend a hotel?
Here’s two hotels we recommend, both a short walk away from the venue:

Holiday Inn (20min walk)
Michelberger Hotel (20min walk)
Other than that, Berlin has a lot of hotels, and even if your hotel isn’t close to the venue, Berlin has a good public transport network, so it’s likely you’ll have no trouble at all getting to the conference.

Is there food for my diet?
Our catering service will provide food options for most diets. If you have a specific diet, feel free to contact us at contact@jsconf.eu.

Can I be a volunteer?
While our volunteer team is currently complete, we might have very few slots open closer to the event, in which case we will post about them on social media.

Are there student tickets?
We do not offer student tickets or discounts, but you can still apply for a scholarship.

I want to sponsor, how?
We’d be happy to have you! You can find more information about sponsoring the conference on our sponsors page.

I want to give a talk, how?
Unfortunately, our Call for Papers has ended since December 31st, 2018.

How do I get my badge to enter the conference?
When doors open at 8:00AM at the venue. There might be different queues based on the first name of the attendee. Additionally, there might be a pre-conference event the day before where you can pick up your badge early. This page will be updated with more information as the conference draws closer.

Will there be photos taken of me?
When getting your badge, you will have the choice between two types of lanyards:

Black Lanyard: This signals our photographer that you’re okay with being in pictures.
Red Lanyard: This signals our photographer that you would prefer not to be in pictures.
Before publishing our official event photos, we double-check and remove any photos that show identifiable people with red lanyards. We would also like to ask attendees not to take and publish pictures that have other attendees with red lanyards in them.

Please note that there might be large group photo opportunities (the “family photo”). If you do not wish to be in this photo, please don’t join the group photo.

Do you have a newsletter or something of the sort?
We do, and you can sign up for it to get news about the conferences roughly twice a month!

Do you have a Code of Conduct?
We have and enforce a code of conduct.

Do you have a quiet room?
We will provide a clearly signposted quiet room during the conference. More information will be added as the conference comes closer.

Do you offer childcare?
We do! We’ll release more information about this soon.

Ticket sales are currently closed, when is the next sale?
See our ticket sale schedule.

Are the talks going to be published as videos?
Yes, over at https://youtube.com/jsconfeu.

I have accessibility concerns, can you help me?
Yes! Head over to our accessibility statement.

I need a proper invoice, what do I do?
Our ticketing system issues proper invoices and you can edit all the detail, even after you have bought the ticket through a link in the confirmation email.
