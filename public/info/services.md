# Services

This is a preliminary list of services we’re offering on-site, so you know what you can expect when attending JSConf EU. Be sure to return to this section, to see what other services we have added over time. Everything on this list is included in the ticket price, (except for textile printing). If you have any questions, do get in touch.

Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks, Wifi
We’re covering all three meals of a day for you with five-star, prepared on-site, fresh and nutritious dishes, and options for many common diets.

We also serve tasty beverages at all hours, from non-sugar options and your favourite mate options, as well as our renowned Espresso bar.

We understand Wifi and internet access are important if you are in a new place with a lot of strangers, so we’ve equipped our venue with all modern 5GHz Wifi that works. Please get in touch if you need access to a 2.4GHz band for legacy devices.

Live Captioning
All talks on our two main stages are live captioned on separate screens to the side of each stage with ample seating for anyone who needs or enjoys subtitles.

Childcare
Parents welcome, bring your 3yo+s! When buying a ticket, you can signify that you are interested in using our childcare services. If there are any things you want to sort out beforehand, please get in touch.

Prayer Room
We have a dedicated prayer room that attendees are welcome to use one at a time. At the conference, talk to any staff member to access it.

Medics
We have medical services standing by on-site for any eventualities.

Textile Print Workshop
Instead of giving away the same t-shirt to every attendee, we decided to turn things around and invite a local textile print service to set up shop at JSConf EU. We’re inviting everyone to submit print screen motives for our attendees to print and customize their favourite garments. Making a print screen is about 60€, if you want to commission one, please get in touch.

For attendees, bring your favourite shirts, socks, skirts and totes to get them customised on site. There are also going to be a variety of textiles available for purchase. Prints are for pay, cash only.

Community Lounge
A conference inside a conference, the Community Lounge runs its own separate-from-the-main-stages events to highlight technology initiatives local to Berlin and Europe. You can find more info on the Community Lounge page.

Quiet Room
For people who need a break from the hustle and bustle of the event, we offer a dedicated quiet area that fits about 20 people in total. This is, however, not a quiet chamber devoid of any sensory input, and more a place to hang out and recharge away from the main conference.
