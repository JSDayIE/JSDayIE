            "abstract": "As technology advances and the applications we build become more complex, the tools that we use to secure the data shared within these products need to follow suit. We need to ensure that we deliver a high standard of protection to users, allowing them them to seamlessly use the product without thinking about security or any potential threat. Even just a thought of any risk could lose us our customers’ trust and therefore millions in investment and in turn threaten our entire business as a whole (including our jobs). A security breach is a very real problem, both personally as an individual and professionally in a business sense. But we as developers can help fix this problem. In very recent years there has been a number of incidents involving npm dependencies pushing vulnerabilities to consumers or exposing data. This led to the npm team purchasing a security tool to prevent future incidents. These incidents can easily be stopped and further prevented from happening again.  NPM is the first main carrier of personal information and it therefore should be where we start to repair these issues. In this talk we will look back on the previous incidents and do a postmortem investigation on what happened, and how it could have been prevented. We will then take a further look into tools and products that can help protect our applications going forward and some basic best security practices that we all should follow, no matter our application."

The inclusion of React.js in Design Systems helped introduce the concept of functional programming as it relates to building components for reuse and scale. What happens if we take it a step further? With Typescript, a superset of Javascript that can be used in conjunction with React.js, your Design System can reach a whole new level of efficiency and power. Not only do you get to include static type-checking at compile time, but you can use interfaces to describe objects with different properties, you can make your IDE respond to the code you write, and much more. This talk will explore how UI engineers, from beginner to experienced, can harness the power of Typescript to help enforce better component standards in the code and allow large-scale Javascript projects to succeed. I will additionally include real-life examples of how we're making Typescript work for our Design System at Twitch, and how it's improving designer/developer relationships. "

So, let's start with a projet that need a huge computing time. We will develop the core code in Rust, compile it to WASM using LLVM, and we will display the results in a front view powered via JavaScript. No need to know how does it work, we will see it together.
