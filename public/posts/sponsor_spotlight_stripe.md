# Sponsor Spotlight: Stripe

Hi everyone! We are very pleased to publicly announce **Stripe** as one of our **Silver** sponsors.

Stripe has helped us not only financially but by providing us with the online tools required to process payments online. JSDayIE 2023 is our very first edition, and a lot of things have been very complicated. However, accepting online payments has been quite simple, and we have to thank Stripe for that.

We would like to sincerely thank Stripe for becoming one of our Silver sponsors because, without their support, this event would not be possible. As a sponsor of JSDayIE and an employer in Ireland, Stripe Labs contributes to the healthy growth of the JS community in Ireland every day.

# What is Stripe and what do you do?

Stripe is a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. Businesses of every size — from new startups to public companies — use our software to accept online payments and run technically sophisticated financial operations in more than 100 countries. Stripe helps companies get started and grow their revenues, and established businesses accelerate into new markets and launch new business models. Over the long term, Stripe aims to increase the GDP of the internet.

# How is Stripe connected to the JS community in Ireland?

With Dublin being Stripe's first engineering hub, we've been actively engaging with the developer community here since 2017, and have hosted the DublinJS meetup in the past.

# Why is Stripe excited for JSDayIE?

Stripe developers use GraphQL and React every day, so we are excited to learn more about how other companies use these tools in production. It will be great to share our love for the small details and our experiences building delightful user experiences with our fellow UI trailblazers. It’s fantastic to have a JS conference in Dublin for the first time - the city is an important engineering hub for us, and we are excited about the growing tech community here.
