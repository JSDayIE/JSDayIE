## What is HMH and what do you do? 

For more than 185 years, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, The Learning Company has inspired all learners to activate curiosity, elevate potential, and find their moments of brilliance and breakthrough. With our magnitude of influence comes great social responsibility—to nurture, develop, and grow the purposeful, empathetic, and determined citizens of tomorrow. 

HMH Engineering is focused on building software to create next generation learning experiences that align to the way today’s teachers want to teach, and all the ways today’s students learn best. 

In Dublin, we have an engineering & delivery team of over 150 people, working in our city centre offices in 152-160 Pearse St., Dublin 2. (Close to Pearse St. Dart & Tesco Express on Pearse Street). 

Our, Agile self-contained engineers and delivery teams, love solving problems and building high quality products and services. Together, we design, build and support custom applications and services, used every day by millions of people worldwide.

## How is HMH connected to the JS community in Ireland? 

HMH has learning at our core, and we are passionate about sharing that with others and learning from others.
