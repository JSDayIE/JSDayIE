# Scholarship Program

![](/media/blog/blog_post_13.png)

We are happy to announce that we are running our Scholarship Program, which provides students and individuals from underrepresented groups with free tickets to attend JSDayIE.

We are very grateful and would like to say a big Thank You to the companies that sponsorship JSDayIE.
We were able to give away some free tickets and we hope to be able to invite even more people in 2020.

Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for a scholarship. We especially invite and welcome students, Black, Indigenous & People of Color, QTIBIPOC/LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, and people facing economic or social hardships.

If you’ve always wanted to visit JSDayIE, but haven’t had the money or resources to, this is your chance! The Scholarship Program was made for you.

❤️ Granting these scholarships is made possible thanks to the wonderful contributions made by our sponsors.

Please contact [irene.yeriskin@jsday.org](mailto:irene.yeriskin@jsday.org) to apply now.
